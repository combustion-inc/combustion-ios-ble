# Combustion Inc. Temperature Probe BLE Library

## Overview

This package enables communication with Combustion Inc. temperature probes probes. It uses Apple's Combine framework, subclassing `ObservableObject` to enable reactive UI development in SwiftUI (and is compatible with Storyboard approaches as well).

## Example project

An example iOS app illustrating the use of this framework is available in the [combustion-ios-example](https://github.com/combustion-inc/combustion-ios-example) repository.

## Usage information

### Swift Package Manager

Simply add this [Github repository](https://github.com/combustion-inc/combustion-ios-ble) to your project via [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

### Target capabilities

The following Capabilities need to be added to your Target (Signing & Capabilities tab in Target settings):

- Background BLE services
  - Enable `Uses Bluetooth LE Accessories`

### Info.plist settings

Additionally, the following entries must be added to your project's `Info.plist`:

- Key: `Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description`

  - Value: Description of reason for Bluetooth access, e.g. "Bluetooth is used to communicate with hardware products."

- Key: `Privacy - Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description`

  - Value: Description of reason for Bluetooth access, e.g. "Bluetooth is used to communicate with hardware products."

## Important Classes

The following classes provide key functionality to apps incorporating this framework.

### `DeviceManager`

`DeviceManager` is an observable singleton class that maintains a dictionary of `Probe` objects that have been discovered over BLE.

#### Important members

- `probes` - Observable dictionary of probes (key is a `String` BLE UUID identifier, value is the `Probe` object)
- `getProbes()` - Function that returns array representation of the `Probe` objects in the `probes` dictionary.

### `Probe` (subclass of `Device`)

An instance of the `Probe` class representes an individual temperature probe that has been discovered via its advertising data. These are retrieved from the `DeviceManager.shared.probes` dictionary.

### Important members

- `serialNumber` - The Probe's unique serial number
- `name` - String format of probe serial number
- `macAddress` - Probe's MAC address
- `macAddressString` - String representation of Probe's MAC address
- `batteryLevel` - Battery level as reported by probe *NOTE: This is not yet implemented in probe firmware and will likely change to a boolean 'battery low' flag in the near future.*
- `currentTemperatures` - `ProbeTemperatures` struct containing the most recent temperatures read by the Probe. 
  - `currentTemperatures.values` - Array of these temperatures, in celsius, where `values[0]` is temperature sensor T1, and `values[7]` is temperature sensor T8.
    - T1 - High-precision temperature sensor in tip of probe
    - T2 - High-precision temperature sensor
    - T3 - MCU temperature sensor
    - T4 - High-precision temperature sensor
    - T5 - High-temperature thermistor
    - T6 - High-temperature thermistor
    - T7 - High-temperature thermistor
    - T8 - High-temperature thermistor on handle tip measuring ambient

- `id` - iOS-provided UUID for the device

- `rssi` - Signal strength between Probe and iOS device

- `maintainingConnection` - Whether the app is currently attempting to maintain a connection with the `Probe`, as directed by the `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods.

- `connect()` - Attempts to connect to device, and instructs framework to attempt to maintain a connection to this probe if it is lost.

- `disconnect()` - Instruct framework to disconnect from this probe, and to no longer attempt to maintain a connection to it.

- `stale` - `true` if no advertising data or notifications have been received from the Probe within the "staleness timeout" (15 seconds), or `false` if recent data has been received.

- `status` - `DeviceStatus` struct containing device status information.
  - `minSequenceNumber` - Minimum sequence number of log records stored on the probe
  - `maxSequenceNumber` - Maximum sequence number of log records stored on the probe

- `logsUpToDate` - Boolean value that indicates whether all log sequence numbers contained in the probe (determined by the `status` sequence number range) have been successfully retrieved and stored in the app's memory.

- `temperatureLog` - `ProbeTemperatureLog` class instance containing all logged temperatures that have been retrieved from the device, and logic that coordinates automatically retrieving all past records when connected to a Probe.
  - Individual logged temperatures are provided in the `temperatureLog.dataPoints` array. These are instances of the struct `LoggedProbeDataPoint`, which contains the point's sequence number and corresponding `ProbeTemperatures` struct as explained above.

## Useful functions

The framework also provides `celsius()` and `fahrenheit()` functions that convert temperatures between these two formats.

## Common usage examples

### Importing this framework

To use the Combustion BLE framework in your own Swift file, import it:

```swift
import CombustionBLE
```

### Rendering list of probes

In SwiftUI, a list of probes can be rendered like so:

```swift
struct EngineeringProbeList: View {
    @ObservedObject var deviceManager = DeviceManager.shared
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(deviceManager.probes.keys.sorted(), id: \.self) { key in
                    if let probe = deviceManager.probes[key] {
                        NavigationLink(destination: EngineeringProbeDetails(probe: probe)) {
                            EngineeringProbeRow(probe: probe)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Probes")
        }
    }
}
```

## Framework features coming soon

The following features are planned for near-term development but are not yet implemented in this version of the Combustion BLE Framework.

### Set ring color

The framework will provide functions allowing a probe's identifying silicone ring color to be configured by the user (colors TBA).

### Set numeric ID

The framework will provide functions allowing a Probe's numeric ID (1-8) to be configured by the user.

### Firmware update

The framework will provide methods for updating a Probe's firmware with a signed firmware image.
